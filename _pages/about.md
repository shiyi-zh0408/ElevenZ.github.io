I'm currently a 1st-year PHD student in Tsinghua University Shenzhen International Graduate School, supervised by Prof. [Yansong Tang](https://andytang15.github.io/) and Prof. [Jiwen Lu](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/biography.html). I got my bachelor's degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2023.

My research interests lie in Computer Vision, such as Video Understanding, and Embodied Visual Perception.
